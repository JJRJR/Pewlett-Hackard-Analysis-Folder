## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then write a report summarizing our analysis to help Pewlett Hackard deal with the large number of employees who are retiring soon. 

## Results

-	The first step was to gather all the retirement-age employees into one table. Once we put this table together, we realized there were duplicates that needed to be removed.

- After we removed the duplicates from the table we can see that there are over 90,000 employees close to retirement age.

- By updating the list to the most current position for each employee and grouping the retirement titles together we can see approximately 70% of the retiring aged employees have senior positions in the company.

- Lastly, we drilled down to the employees that have birth dates that are between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965, to create a table of people eligible for the mentor program.

## Conclusion
After creating the tables I believe Pewlett Hackard is in a great position to set up their mentor program not just for now, but they will have a good idea of who will be eligible in the upcoming years as well. This should allow them to get ahead of the issue and create a game plan that will help them deal with their large retiring body of employees. Since the majority of the retiring employees are in some kind of senior position I believe a mentorship program is a great idea. All those years of experience could go to waste otherwise.
